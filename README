COMPILING

This game was written in the D programming language, available from
http://www.digitalmars.com/d/.  You can get either the DMD compiler (Windows
and Linux) or the GDC compiler (works with GCC toolkit so works anywhere).
You'll also need to get Derelict (http://www.dsource.org/projects/derelict)
and Build (http://www.dsource.org/projects/build).  If you're not on
Windows, you'll have to make sure SDL is installed (www.libsdl.org).  Once
you have everything set up, just go into the ResPancake folder and
type

build -I/path/to/derelict/files respancake

on the command line.  (You can see an example command line in compile.bat.)

Note that OSX with Intel Macs has some issues with SDL.  Derelict isn't
the only SDL library that has issues with it; pygame doesn't work either.
So get a better operating system.  LOL
